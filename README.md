# Data Analytics Portfolio: Fintech Loan Analysis (GCP)
**By Chaya Seethepalli | Google Cloud Certified | 7 Years QA Expertise**

## 🎯 Overview
After 7 years of ensuring software quality, I transitioned into Data Analytics to focus on **Data Integrity**. This portfolio demonstrates my ability to manage the full data lifecycle—from raw ingestion in BigQuery to executive visualization in Looker.

## 🛠️ Project 1: Data Engineering & Transformation (BigQuery)
In this capstone, I acted as the Data Analyst for a fintech firm to clean and structure loan data.

### Key Actions:
* **Data Ingestion:** Imported CSV datasets into a standard BigQuery table environment.
* **Complex Joins:** Merged disparate tables (Loan data + State Classifications) to create a unified reporting view.
* **Data Quality (QA Mindset):** Applied `SELECT DISTINCT` and `CTAS` (Create Table As Select) methods to deduplicate records and ensure 100% data accuracy.
* **SQL Logic:** Utilized aggregation and filtering to report on total loan amounts by year and day.

## 📊 Project 2: Business Intelligence & Insights (Looker)
I built an interactive Looker Enterprise dashboard to help stakeholders "Activate" the data.

### Key Insights Provided:
* **Financial Health:** Visualized total outstanding loans vs. status (Current vs. Default).
* **Geographic Trends:** Identified the Top 10 states by loan count.
* **Segmentation:** Filtered customers who own homes outright with "Current" loan statuses for targeted marketing.
* **Optimization:** Enabled cross-filtering and dashboard auto-refresh for real-time decision-making.
